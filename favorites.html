        <p>Games has been a big part of my life, espescally games that have characters
        from Japan.(character like Sonic, Mario, Naruto and Goku.) These japaness
        games had always been more fun than games from america that produces games
        like Call of Duty, Battlefield and others. The japaness games typically 
        have greater story better characters and stuff like that. Also what thses
        anime games do is that they are willing to take risk with game design, 
        artwork,and game mechanics. My favorite games are located below. These 
        games are here because they do something different and new that games here in the west don't do often or don't do well. With all this said I don't hate games from america. Some are quite fun like games
        like Fortnite, Destiny and more. American games rule the muiltplayer 
        market while Anime games are better in terms of story and uniqueness.
