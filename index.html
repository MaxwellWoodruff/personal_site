         <p>Hi I'm Max and this is my website. Wiht this piece of work you get 
         to know about me and my hobbies and what I think about stuff like games,
         anime and music. This page is dedicated to music part of me. Music is a
         part of life that is very important to must people incuding me. Unlike 
         most people I don't have a specific genre of music that is better than 
         others. I can enjoy,dubstep,Jazz and everything in between. But the only
         music I can't enjoy is rap. Rap to me is terrible in comparison to other
         types of music, it hardly has a pattern to it and it just doesn't sound
         good to my ears. But there are few exceptions. The rapping part in a song
         in Persona 3 was good to listen to, but the only reason why was because
         it was in conjunction with other parts of the song. My favorite songs and
         artist are listed below.
