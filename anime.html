            <p> Anime is a type of show that is underrating and amazing. Anime 
            makes new ideas and make them into something enjoyable to watch. For
            example, most people would say that a main character that wins nearly
            all of his with only one punch. It's it might seem fun for the first
            few times but after a while it gets boring. That is not the case for
            an anime that aired in the fall season of 2015 called One Punch Man.
            There are anime like One Punch Man too. Anime that make new idea,
            improve on america tv show like the Averagers and more. Also anime 
            seems to always show the team behides strengths, wrinting, artwork 
            and more. Also with anime, this part of entertainment can connect 
            with people more than american tv in different ways. Anime can 
            connect to a person's wild side with bright, fast paced action 
            sences like they do in My Hero Academia, connect to a person's heart
            with personal struggles and achivments that characters go though 
            like in an anime that aired in the Fall 2016 season called March 
            comes in Like Lion. Anime can also connect with people anyone in 
            between. My favorite anime are listed below. </p>
